# PissedMan - A simpler Postman style API querying GUI

The main purpose of this project is to provide the very basic request/response functionality that the postman tool provides, for use in day-to-day development, as Postman cannot be installed on my work laptop without admin privs for some reason.

Initial scope is to build a basic UI for entering uri, auth info, json request body and displaying response details and body.

Functionality can then be expanded upon in the future but my personal requirements for this sort of tool are usually very basic.
